// Note that the Unmarshal function is not UnmarshalJSON for a specific reason -
// it is impossible to implement a typed JSON unmarshaler in Go for an array
// type because it must by definition have a sentinel field which in the case of
// nostr is the Label. Objects have a defined collection of recognised labels
// and with omitempty marking the mandatory ones, acting as a "kind" of sentinel.
