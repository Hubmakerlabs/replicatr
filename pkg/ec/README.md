=====

This is a full drop-in replacement for
[github.com/btcsuite/btcd/btcec](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/tree/master/btcec)
eliminating the import from the Decred repository, and including the chainhash
helper functions, needed for hashing messages for signatures.

The decred specific tests also have been removed, as well as all tests that use
blake256 hashes as these are irrelevant to bitcoin and nostr. Some of them
remain present, commented out, in case it is worth regenerating the vectors
based on sha256 hashes, but on first blush it seems unlikely to be any benefit.

This includes the old style compact secp256k1 ECDSA signatures, that recover the
public key rather than take a key as a parameter as used in Bitcoin
transactions, the new style Schnorr signatures, and the Musig2 implementation.

BIP 340 Schnorr signatures are implemented except for the nonstandard message
length
tests, that nobody uses anyway.

The remainder of this document is from the original README.md.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package `ec` implements elliptic curve cryptography needed for working with
Bitcoin. It is designed so that it may be used with the standard
crypto/ecdsa packages provided with Go.

A comprehensive suite of testis provided to ensure proper functionality.

Package btcec was originally based on work from ThePiachu which is licensed
under
the same terms as Go, but it has signficantly diverged since then. The btcsuite
developers original is licensed under the liberal ISC license.
