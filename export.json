A federation that is moving funds privately between them.\n\nBut then LN was launched and come in force and Liquid kinda lost the use case.\n\nThe block size war was also over, segwit in place and onchain mempool liberated, so even the exchanges that were excited about Liquid, they were still preferring to do it over onchain as usual.\nLN got more and more grip and Liquid was slowly forgotten and became useless.\n\nNow Blockstream, want to push people into using it as it would be a \"cheapest and fastest\" way instead of LN, because they do not want to see it terminated (as nobody is using it). In the end they put a lot of effort and money to build it.\n\nIMHO they should go back to the original idea to be used for private entities and not pushed to large masses of users.\n\nNow all those onchain maxis want to use Liquid instead of preparing in time, with calm new LN channels. That's why this crazy mania with Liquid.
